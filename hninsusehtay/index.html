                    <h2><b><br>Shwedagon Pagoda</b></h2>
                    <p><br>The Shwedagon or Greater Dragon Pagoda is considered the most 
                        sacred site in Buddhism in Myanmar because it contains a strand of 
                        Buddha’s hair and other religious relics. The 2,500-year-old pagoda is 
                        located on Singuttara Hill in Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar. Over 
                        the centuries, the pagoda has grown from 8 meters to 99 meters (26 feet 
                        to 366 feet). The origins of Shwedagon are lost in antiquity but it is 
                        estimated that the Pagoda was first built by the Mon during the Bagan 
                        period, sometime between the 6th and 10th century AD. It is covered in 
                        gold leaf; the stupa is covered in 4,531 diamonds. Numerous temples, 
                        statues and stupas can be found at this unforgettable site. Pagoda 
                        visitors are expected to follow a dress code (trousers preferred, 
                        T-shirts with elbow-length sleeves) and enter the temple barefooted.</p>

                    <h1><b><br>Bagan</b></h1>
                    <p><br>Travelers with a passion for Buddhist temples, pagodas and stupas
                            should have a field day in Bagan, since it contains more of these than 
                           any other place in the world. The most popular destination in Myanmar, 
                           Bagan was the capital of the First Burmese Empire from the 9th to the 
                           13th centuries. The site that Marco Polo once described as the “gilded 
                           city” was home to around Buddhist 13,000 temples in its 11th-century 
                           heyday. Thousands of temples, stupas and pagodas remain, including the 
                           famous Ananda temple with its sparkling gold spires.</p>

                <h1><b><br>Ngapali Beach</b></h1>
                <p><br>Ngapali combines two worlds in this Southeast Asian country. It 
                    is Myanmar’s premier resort town, with white sand beaches lining the 
                    blue waters of the Bay of Bengal and luxury hotels. It is a great spot 
                    to chill out and just relax. Contrast this with its fishing village 
                    atmosphere with local restaurants serving the day’s catch and ox-carts 
                    doubling as taxis. Locals believe the town is named after Napoli 
                    (Naples) in Italy. Most people visit Ngapali November to March; the rest
                     of the year it is a sleepy little beach town.</p>

                     <p><br>Vast and serene Inle Lake is one of the top tourist attractions 
                        in Myanmar. Besides its considerable natural beauty the lake also 
                        attracts tourists for the stilt houses of the Intha, the descendants of 
                        Mon people from the far southeast. A typical day-trip on the lake, taken
                         in a long, narrow boat with a noisy outboard motor, will stick to the 
                        northern reaches of Inle Lake. These trips also include visits to small 
                        workshops in stilt villages, several pagodas and probably a market. 
                        Travelers are also likely to see fishermen propelling their boats using a
                         distinctive leg-rowing technique, and other Intha residents of the lake
                         tending to fruit and vegetables on floating gardens.</p>
